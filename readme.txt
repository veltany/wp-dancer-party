Bring life to your WordPress audio players with animated dancers that dance to the music beat!

== Description ==

When visitors click play on a WordPress audio player, cute animated dancers appear on the screen and dance in real-time to the beat and energy of the music.

**Features:**
- Responds to WordPress native `[audio]` shortcode.
- Dancers react to audio loudness using Web Audio API.
- Supports adding custom dancers from Media Library (up to 3).
- Choose from random dance animations: bounce, fly, shake, spin, fade.
- Zero jQuery dependency. Pure vanilla JavaScript.
- Lightweight and highly optimized.
- Hide dancers when audio is paused or stopped.

**Perfect for:**  
Music blogs, podcast websites, kids and education sites, fun landing pages, and anyone who wants a lively website!
