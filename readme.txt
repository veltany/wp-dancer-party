Bring your WordPress audio players to life with animated dancers that react to the beat!

== Description ==

WP Dancer Party brings MP3 Dancer vibes to your WordPress site!  
When a native WordPress audio player `[audio]` is played, lively dancers appear and dance according to the music's loudness and energy.

**Highlights:**
- Pure vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery).
- Real-time audio beat detection.
- Add up to 3 custom dancers from Media Library.
- Random dance styles: bounce, fly, shake, spin, fade.
- Hide dancers when audio pauses or stops.

Lightweight, fast, fun, and highly optimized.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Configure your dancer settings under **Settings â†’ WP Dancer Party**.
4. Insert an `[audio]` shortcode where you want the music to play.
